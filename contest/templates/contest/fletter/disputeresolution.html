   and low income tenants may not have to pay the fee at all.

      d. written submission
      Introduction – In 2 or 3 sentences state what the dispute is about.

      Background / Facts – Describe the facts that led to the dispute.
          What happened? You may want to reference some of your evidence here.
          (For example, you might say “on April 1, 2014, I signed a tenancy agreement, which is attached here on page…”)

      Law / Policy – Cite relevant sections of the Residential Tenancy Act, other pieces of law, or RTB Policy Guidelines

      Argument – Explain why you should win the hearing. This might include a
        description of why your landlord’s evidence or argument is inaccurate or weak.
        Again, you may need to cite law / policy to strengthen your argument.

      Remedy Sought – Tell the arbitrator what you want the outcome of the hearing to be.
         For example, you want a Notice to End Tenancy to be cancelled,
         you want an order requiring the landlord to pay you money,
         or you want an order that your landlord make repairs, etc.

Monetary damages -
      In some situations you may want to apply for an order that your landlord pay you money to compensate for an expense or loss that you have incurred. This is called a monetary order. You will need to complete and submit the Monetary Order Worksheet, which gives an explanation for how you calculated the amount of money you are seeking.
      In order to be awarded damages you will need to provide evidence of the following:
      That the damage exists.
      That the damage or loss happened because of the actions or neglect of your landlord, in violation of the Residential Tenancy Act (RTA) or your tenancy agreement.
      Verification of the actual amount of money necessary to compensate you for your loss or rectify the damage.
      That you took steps to minimize your landlord’s loss.

Aggravated damages
      In some situations, tenants can request that their landlord be ordered to
       pay them aggravated damages. Aggravated damages is money that a landlord
       must pay to compensate for serious suffering, which might not have a
       dollar value. Examples include if a tenant has experienced physical injury
        or illness, mental suffering, humiliation, etc. due to a landlord not
        complying with the RTA or the tenancy agreement.
       You must specifically request a monetary order for aggravated damages.
