# Tenant's Talk
 
 An app built in Django that offers free information for tenants facing a residential tenancy law issue in B.C.
 The app walks tenants through a simple series of questions, offers a form letter, and provides instructions on how to contest
 unlawful landlord behaviour. Inspired by donotpay.co.uk among other nifty legal tech tools out there. 
 
 The app also has a reporting function where tenants can report bad landlords.
 
 This app is in early beta. I'm hoping to launch in February of 2017. 
 
More soon.
